            <h3 class="c-faq__heading">Why meal in a pill?</h3>
            <div class="c-faq__body">
                <p>The ability to offer a perfect meal in the convenience of a pill, exactly replicating the micro and macronutrients of a wide variety of “real food” meals such as Wild Salmon with kale, avocado and coconut oil or Grass-Fed Steak with sweet potato and asparagus offers value in many different areas from the Defense Department, to Hospitals, to Space Programs, Professional Athletes, and Government Foreign Aid Programs.</p>

    <div class="c-faq">
        <div class="c-faq__row">
            <h3 class="c-faq__heading">Why hasn’t this been done before?</h3>
            <div class="c-faq__body">
                <p>People have taken the word “pill” too literally and came to the conclusion it was impossible to fit sufficient calories in such a small space, which is true when you think of a literal capsule. (Link to article.) We originally got the idea from how prisoners smuggle drugs into prison by swallowing balloons and thought to ourselves “what if we could create an edible, digestible membrane/balloon to encapsulate our micro/macronutrients and calories inside?” Taking this approach opened up many different possible avenues.</p>

        <div class="c-faq__row">
            <h3 class="c-faq__heading">So is it safe? What is it made of?</h3>
            <div class="c-faq__body">
                <p>So each pill is made up of different components depending on the “real food” meal it’s mimicking. Say we were doing a grass-fed steak with sweet potatoes and asparagus, we’d have the exact amino acid profile of a grass-fed steak, sweet potato powder, fiber from hydrolyzed guar gum, and the exact micronutrients of the asparagus, steak, and sweet potato with an outer “lining” of sodium alginate, kuzu root starch, locust bean gum, and pectin. </p>

        <div class="c-faq__row">
            <h3 class="c-faq__heading">How are you doing this affordably?</h3>
            <div class="c-faq__body">
                <p>Simply by rejecting certain ingredients that don’t have the ability to cost-scale, not doing “science” for the sake of doing science, causing unnecessary production complexities, and seeking contracts with the right organizations for necessary production runs. </p>

        <div class="c-faq__row">
            <h3 class="c-faq__heading">Do you have a rough estimated cost per meal?</h3>
            <div class="c-faq__body">
                <p>Each meal variety will have a different cost structure, but we’re projecting $7/meal as an average.</p>

    <div class="c-faq">
        <div class="c-faq__row">
            <h3 class="c-faq__heading">Does this have higher or lower absorption rates than “real food?”</h3>
            <div class="c-faq__body">
                <p>Macronutrient and calorie wise it is the same as real food, around 90%. But when it comes to micronutrients, absorption rates fluctuate wildly in “real food” whereas by using micro-encapsulation techniques were able to design our micronutrients to only “open” once they make it pass the small intestine, allowing for higher absorption rates, not to mention our pill has a higher surface area in a gel-based solution which already helps absorption.</p>

    <div class="c-faq">
        <div class="c-faq__row">
            <h3 class="c-faq__heading">Why all kinds of meal varieties and not just one?</h3>
            <div class="c-faq__body">
                <p>Well first, you just need a wide array of micronutrients and macronutrients to sustain a healthy body and mind. Even in the short term for optimal function. This pill isn’t to “survive” it’s truly to give people the most nutritious meals on the planet that have more absorbable nutrients than actual food.</p>
            </div>
         </div>
    </div>

    <div class="c-faq">
        <div class="c-faq__row">
            <h3 class="c-faq__heading">Will this actually fill me up?</h3>
            <div class="c-faq__body">
                <p>Yes each meal-in-a-pill has 400-450 calories, and has the exact micronutrient/macronutrient breakdown that the “real food” meal would have. We’ve thought a lot about making sure this pill caused satiation and worked with food scientists who study what causes satiation beyond just calories/nutrition using specific ingredients over others that cause more fullness “satiety” than others. </p>
                <p>Second, it’s about linking the unknown to the known. It’s freaky to consume a meal in a pill so when we say this thing is exactly a chicken breast with kale spinach and sweet potato (which it really is) it’s much easier for people to conceptualize it and understand it. </p>
